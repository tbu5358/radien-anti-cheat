/**
 * BotModule Interface - Phase 1: Foundation (Modular Architecture)
 *
 * This interface defines the contract that all bot modules must implement.
 * It provides a standardized way to initialize, monitor, and shutdown
 * different components of the Anti-Cheat Moderation Bot.
 *
 * Key Benefits:
 * - Single Responsibility: Each module handles one concern
 * - Testability: Modules can be unit tested in isolation
 * - Scalability: New modules can be added without affecting existing ones
 * - Monitoring: Health checks enable proactive issue detection
 * - Graceful Shutdown: Proper cleanup prevents resource leaks
 *
 * Future developers: When adding new modules, implement this interface
 * to ensure consistent behavior and monitoring capabilities.
